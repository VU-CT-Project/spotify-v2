# spotify-v2
a program that mimics Spotify’s “Discover Weekly”

Spotify has been dominating the audio streaming market for over 15 years, we have created a new music streaming service that personalises the program to the users needs.
We will be solving the problem of user personalisation in three different steps over a number of weeks.
Week 1: Discover Feature. We will be using 100 pre-made playlists to give the user 5 unique songs that they have no heard before.

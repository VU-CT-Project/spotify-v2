# spotify-v2
a program that mimics Spotify’s “Discover Weekly”

Spotify has been dominating the audio streaming market for over 15 years, we have created a new music streaming service that personalises the program to the users needs.
We will be solving the problem of user personalisation in three different steps over a number of weeks.
Week 1: Discover Feature. We will be using 100 pre-made playlists to give the user 5 unique songs that they have not heard before.
Week 2: Genres. We will find the users 2 most popular music genres and give them 5 song recommendations based on the genre of music the user enjoys listening to.
Week 3: Moods. This week, we will be looking at the moods the music is linked to; so Happy, Calm or Party. We will look at the mood shifts during the week and use the algorithm to decide what type of songs we should recommend to the user. This will look at previous weeks and the current week and suggest songs in their current Mood state and recommend 5 songs to them based on their currently personal preferences.
